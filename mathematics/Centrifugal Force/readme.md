How does Centrifugal Force Scale with Radius?

Is a larger radius but same velocity, more or less energy efficient?

Equation:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force
Force = mw^2r

# Solution:
A smaller centrifuge should apply greater Forces, however the radius decreases alot fast from the edge.

# At Perimeter:


## size = 1
mass 10
angular 2
radius 10


400 = 10*2^2*10

## size = 1/2
mass 10
angular 4
radius 5


800 = 10*4^2*5

It can work to a limited extent - with effort. Been there, done that on a Mercedes IDI and a Powerstroke. The stuff does burn. the problem you have is the part of the used oil that makes it black - carbon. the carbon doesn't burn. It also likes to stick to things inside the cumbustion chamber. On a Powerstroke, it will stick to the injector tips and you have to pull and clean them after about 300 miles. Did that about 100 times - literally. The IDI engines are somewhat protected, so the problem isn't the same. But you will eventually have problems like stuck rings.

Take a sample of the finished "black diesel," put it in a lab-type table top centrifuge, and spin it for about 5 minutes. You will see that there is still sludge left. the big centrifuge got a bunch of it out, but not all of it. If there is any black color left, there is still sludge left. BTW - if you add the gasoline before the centrifuge, the oil will be even thinner and will filter better.

All of these problems can be dealt with if you are willing to keep taking your engine apart and clean whatever is mucked up. It was more cost-effective when diesel was over $4.00/gallon - not so much any more. Let me know when you make light-tan diesel.

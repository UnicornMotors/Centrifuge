It can work to a limited extent - with effort. Been there, done that on a Mercedes IDI and a Powerstroke. The stuff does burn. the problem you have is the part of the used oil that makes it black - carbon. the carbon doesn't burn. It also likes to stick to things inside the cumbustion chamber. On a Powerstroke, it will stick to the injector tips and you have to pull and clean them after about 300 miles. Did that about 100 times - literally. The IDI engines are somewhat protected, so the problem isn't the same. But you will eventually have problems like stuck rings.

Take a sample of the finished "black diesel," put it in a lab-type table top centrifuge, and spin it for about 5 minutes. You will see that there is still sludge left. the big centrifuge got a bunch of it out, but not all of it. If there is any black color left, there is still sludge left. BTW - if you add the gasoline before the centrifuge, the oil will be even thinner and will filter better.

All of these problems can be dealt with if you are willing to keep taking your engine apart and clean whatever is mucked up. It was more cost-effective when diesel was over $4.00/gallon - not so much any more. Let me know when you make light-tan diesel.

I would never run it in newer stuff but I've run it in my older tractors(Kubota,Zetor,Case and Cat)for over 15 years with NONE of the problems you described.
Seriously if you rnit in a modern Powerstroke you were looking for a problem imho.

idk about stuck rings. any diesel oil worth buying that is changed at regular intervals should keep your rings from getting stuck unless the cyl is washed and/or the rings are toast anyways, assuming that in either case blow by is causing the buildup.
100 times literally? idk man...
depending on your particular mixture the base timing needs to be adjusted to compensate for the lower cetane quality (ignition delay). i run waste motor oil and atf in my 5.7 olds. i dont have smoke if i mix with a little gas in a roughly the same 1:4 ratio. i advanced the base timing another 6-10 degrees and it really cleaned it up. now if i run it on diesel, i have to back the timing off that same 6-10 (i have another timing mark on the pump that i use) or itll smoke under light load, the idle gets "herky-jerky", and gets really smokey under heavy load. (all clear signs of the need to adjust the baseline to compensate for the burn rate and ignition delay)
 the oil gets dirty at about the same rate, like any idi, its black after the first half hour of driving. power is the same, after the lower burn rate is compensated for.
wanna keep the combustion chamber clean? i also run water meth (yes naturally aspirated) not for power, but to keep the soot from finding a home. its a 90-10 mixture, so the chances of detonation are minimized (olds 5.7 is a 22.5:1 comp ratio engine), and i share the reservoir with the washer nozzles too. i had a vacuum line for the egr valve that ended on the inside of the filter element, after i filled the egr ports in the heads, lower and upper intake, and ground out the egr pedestal in the upper intake, the hose became a nice (sealed from atmosphere, metered by intake flow) water/meth "nozzle".
my idle smoothed out after the first 2 hours of straight highway driving on the waste oil. i think the injection pump appreciates the lubrication!!
the engine is more than capable of steam cleaning itself. on a powerstroke with split shot injectors id imagine the pre shot would get the steam where you want it, then the rest of the fuel charge would reeeeeeally get things cleaned. idk if the extra steam pressure between injector shots could effect timing of the main charge or spike cyl pressures on its on though.
to wrap it up, i think the stuff works fine. but im only at around 1000 miles so far, most people told me the engine alone wouldnt make it that far!

Iâ€™d be more worried about the life of the injector pump with those micro sized particles running through it, freshly made petroleum diesel has particles smaller than 5 or so microns, which works for a long time with those small clearance pumps, I donâ€™t know how long a pump would last on poorly filtered black diesel. You should probably fit a series of filters in your final mixing tank before you run it in your truck.

I can attest to this I have a 1996 Volkswagen Passat TDI with direct injection. I use an open bowl centrifuge to clean my black diesel. I was getting the same thing build up on the injector tips after about 300 to 400 mils. This would make the car run like crap and smoke bad. I would pull the injectors and clean them then the car ran fine again for about 300 to 400 mils. I reaped this many time this past summer trying different thing to make it better but getting the same result. It just seems like the oil is too dirty. I live in Wisconsin and Iâ€™m back on regular diesel for the winter and my car runs grate. But I donâ€™t want to give up on getting this to work, so next season I will try some different things to get it to work better but if anybody has some suggestions please feel free to let me know.

You pulled the valve covers, removed all eight injectors, and cleaned all eight injector tips ... 100 times? I call bullshit.

If you are having to clean your injectors 100 times you are feeding way too much into your centrifuge at 1 time... works best when you flow 1/2 capacity... my black oil comes out pretty clean and i run it through the centrifuge twice when itâ€™s really dark.. 8 years in and i have no issues so far.. my fuel filters last about 6 months too

Are you mixing with diesel or gasoline?  @The TDI Guy

 @The TDI Guy  Maybe you can try putting some magnets around your main fuel line,keeping avoid touching one`s to another,or the proper metal conduit,using some tape.This arrangement helps improving the burning of your diesel,in order to clean your injectors too,and gain some power at the process.Maybe your injection pump becomes more noisy than usual,but runs o.k.And itÂ´s almost inexpensive;some pieces of ceramic magnet...

 @Orlando Pizzio  That's complete nonsense. What, exactly, would a magnet do? Carbon is nonmagnetic. And even if it were magnetic, all it would accomplish is plugging the fuel lines where the magnets are located.

 @bethesdaautomotive  I mix 16 gallons of used motor oil after cleaning in center fuse with 2 gallons of diesel and 2 gallons of gasoline and 4 ounces of acetone. Followed thru a one micron filter at Tractor Supply.

Theoretically, if you ran wmo through your centrifuge say 20 times, would it still look black? Is it possible to filter out much of the carbon to make it clear or somewhat clear? I've burned wvo with my system but never wmo and never with a centrifuge. Just very curious.

 @Chris Williams  I have used a desktop centrifuge with sample test tubes just to see what is possible. Without using an agent to cause the carbon to come out of suspension - a de-emulsifier - I can't get all of the carbon to come out. I got a de-emulsifier to work once, but I couldn't get it to repeat, and it made the oil corrosive as hell. And a desktop centrifuge will separate almost anything. WVO on the other hand... I can make that stuff look like it's ready for cooking again.

 @Jeff Johnson  so after running the wmo through many many times (without emulsifiers) it didn't lighten up or get any more clear? Still looked like black motor oil?

 @Chris Williams  Diesel oil still looks black. Gasoline motor oil looks a little different. A TON of sludge comes out of it. It's like flammable clay. That's why I kept trying the process for so long - I was getting garbage out, so I knew I was doing some good. I always wanted to come up with a good use for the sludge, but never did.
